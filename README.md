# TensorBoard


[TensorBoard](https://www.tensorflow.org/tensorboard/)  provides the visualization and tooling needed for machine learning experimentation:

- Tracking and visualizing metrics such as loss and accuracy
- Visualizing the model graph (ops and layers)
- Viewing histograms of weights, biases, or other tensors as they change over time
- Projecting embeddings to a lower dimensional space
- Displaying images, text, and audio data
- Profiling TensorFlow programs



To launch this project on CML:

**As ML Prototype** - In a CML workspace, click "New Project", add a Project Name, select "ML Prototype" as the Initial Setup option, copy in the [repo URL](https://github.com/hortonworks-sk/tensorboard-cml-amp.git), click "Create Project", click "Configure Project"

The AMP comes prepopulated with 

** Tracking Visualizations (loss and accuracy)

** A Model Graph ![MLflow UI in CML](/images/TensorboardGraphs.png)
** Visualizations of Weights, biases ![MLflow UI in CML](/images/TensorboardHistograms.png)
